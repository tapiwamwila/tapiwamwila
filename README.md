Hi, I'm Tapiwa, a passionate machine learning enthusiast and  budding data scientist. I am interested in machine learning for hydrology, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative projects, share knowledge, and learn from the community. Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute to ongoing projects, or reach out for collaboration. 

Currently, I'm working on exciting projects that aim to bridge the gap in technology for diverse accents, making voice recognition more inclusive and accurate for everyone. I am also exploring hydrology datasets like CAMELS to build models on. Thank you!
